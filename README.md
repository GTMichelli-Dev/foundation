## Features

- **Real-Time Scale Display** — Live weight readings from connected scales with motion/error status
- **Multiple Scales** — Named site scales (grain-management style): operators pick the scale on the weigh forms, each kiosk is mapped to a scale, and every ticket records which scale captured each weighment
- **Weigh In / Weigh Out** — Record inbound and outbound truck weights with automatic net weight calculation
- **Inbound & Completed Trucks** — Track trucks currently on-site and view completed transactions
- **Reports** — Date-range filtering, group by (Customer, Carrier, Commodity, etc.), export to Excel and PDF
- **Scheduled Email Reports** — Excel workbooks of what was weighed, emailed daily, weekly, or monthly to any number of recipients; filter by customer, commodity, and location, and optionally split each commodity onto its own worksheet
- **Load Emails** — Email a message per load as it's weighed out, filtered by customer, commodity, both, or neither
- **Master Data Tables** — Manage Customers, Carriers, Trucks, Commodities, Locations, and Destinations (tabs follow field visibility; dropdown custom fields get their own tab)
- **Custom Fields** — Admin-defined ticket fields (text, dropdown, integer, decimal with min/max) that appear on the weigh forms, grids, kiosk prompts, and printed tickets — placeable anywhere in the ticket designer
- **Field Ordering** — Standard and custom fields share one sort order that drives the weigh forms, with the two form columns kept balanced automatically
- **Kiosk Mode** — Touchscreen-optimized interface for unattended scale houses (1280x800 resolution)
- **Cards** — A card carries a load's details, so nobody enters them at the scale. The loader operator issues it with the details on it; the driver presents it at a kiosk card reader or keys its number in on the kiosk keypad, and weighs in and out without answering prompts. Cards deactivate when the load closes, or recycle for the next trip
- **Retained Tare** — A truck's empty weight is stored on weigh-out and reused, so a return trip closes in one weighment. When a truck has a stored tare, the kiosk and the phone page tell the driver what it is and let them either finish on it or **reset** it — a reset clears the stored weight and keeps the ticket open so the real weigh-out captures a fresh one. Whether a driver may reset is gated per source (kiosk, phone, prox card) in Setup; with a gate off that source applies the stored tare automatically instead. Tares expire overnight by default, and the office can view, edit, or clear them on the Retained Tare page
- **Gate & Light Control** — A Raspberry Pi ([Gate Controller Service](GateControllerService/README.md)) opens a gate or turns on a light when a ticket completes on the scale it serves, releasing once the truck drives off or a timeout expires. Per-scale, and entirely optional
- **On-Scale Detection** — Optional photo-eyes at each end of the deck, wired to two Pi inputs. While either beam is broken the truck is hanging off the platform, so the kiosk, phone page and weigh forms show **NOT ON SCALE** and refuse to capture. A scale with no detectors wired behaves exactly as before
- **Remote Printing** — Print tickets to thermal printers via Raspberry Pi print agents over SignalR
- **Ticket Designer** — Edit ticket layouts with the built-in DevExpress Report Designer
- **Driver Signature Capture** — Operator-device overlay or a remote signature-pad tablet (opened by scanning a QR code on the Setup page)
- **Bilingual (English / Spanish)** — Off by default; one checkbox in Setup turns it on. The driver-facing screens — kiosk, the phone page, the signature pad and the ticket views — then render in either language, with a site default, an on-screen **EN / ES** button per device, and a kiosk Pi pinnable to one language at install time. Office and admin pages are English
- **User Login & Roles** — Optional login with User, Manager, and Admin roles
- **Customizable** — Themes, custom icons, configurable kiosk prompts, and editable ticket templates; Setup changes auto-save
- **Demo Mode** — Built-in scale simulator for testing without hardware, one independent simulator per defined scale

## Deployment Guides

Pick the path that matches where the app will run. Each guide is self-contained — follow it end to end.

| Target | When to use it | Guide |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| **Debian cloud server** (Vultr, etc.) | Internet-facing site with a real domain and HTTPS. Required if you need access from outside the LAN or want Let's Encrypt SSL. | [docs/deploy-vultr.md](docs/deploy-vultr.md) |
| **Raspberry Pi on the LAN** (HTTP) | Single weigh station, operators on the same local network, no domain or certificate. Reachable at `http://truckscale.local`. | [docs/deploy-pi.md](docs/deploy-pi.md) |
| **Windows server or PC** | The office already runs Windows and you would rather not add a Linux box. Unzip the release package and run `INSTALL-WEB.bat` as administrator: a Windows service on port 5110, or `INSTALL-WEB.bat -Port 80` to reach it as `http://<pc-name>/` with no port (see [Port 80](docs/deploy-windows.md#port-80)). | [docs/deploy-windows.md](docs/deploy-windows.md) |
| **Raspberry Pi kiosk display** | A second Pi (per kiosk display) wired to the scale-house TV. Boots straight into Chromium pointed at `<server>/Kiosk` with a watchdog that restarts the browser on outage. Bootstrap is a one-shot paste into [Raspberry Pi Connect](https://connect.raspberrypi.com); install.sh prompts for the kiosk PIN, service-id, and printer-id and assembles the full URL. | [RaspberryPiKiosk/README.md](RaspberryPiKiosk/README.md) |
| **Raspberry Pi branding** | Cosmetic, run on any Pi in the fleet. Replaces the boot splash and desktop with Michelli artwork, quiets the boot, and rotates the screen. One-shot — run once, reboot once, done. | [Pi_Branding/README.md](Pi_Branding/README.md) |

After the app is running, see [Server Management](#server-management) for updates and routine ops, and [Configuration](#configuration) for app settings.

> **Field commissioning tip:** to configure a headless Pi's network from a phone (tech access point + browser-based Wi-Fi/ethernet setup and connectivity test), install [pi-network-setup](https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/pi-network-setup) on the Pi alongside the app.

> **DeskPi Lite hardware note:** the extra USB ports on a DeskPi Lite adapter board are dead out of the box — the Pi 4's USB-C port they hang off is left in peripheral mode. One line in `/boot/firmware/config.txt` fixes it: [DeskPi Lite: Enabling the Extra USB Ports](docs/deskpi-lite-usb.md). Applies to any Pi role, not just the web app.

### Pi access to private repos (GitHub App token)

Deploy Pis clone private GTMichelli-Dev repos (pi-network-setup,
camera-capture-service, qb-sync-service) over plain HTTPS using a **GitHub App
installation token** instead of PATs or SSH keys. A one-time bootstrap per Pi
installs a git credential helper that mints short-lived tokens from the App's
private key — after that, `git clone` / `git pull` of any org repo just works
on the box.

The scripts and the walkthrough live in
**[pi-git-auth](https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/pi-git-auth)**, their own
public repo, so every service repo points at one copy — and so a Pi that
cannot authenticate to anything yet can still fetch the installer.

**From Raspberry Pi Connect** (no SSH, no file copy — the usual field case):

```bash
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/gh-auth.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTMichelli-Dev/pi-git-auth/main/scripts/pi-connect-github-auth.sh
bash /tmp/gh-auth.sh </dev/tty
```

It asks for the Installation ID and takes the PEM as a paste, stripping the
`^[[201~` bracketed-paste markers the Connect web shell appends to the last
line — which would otherwise corrupt the key. Have the `.pem` open in a text
editor before you start. The
[step-by-step path](https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/pi-git-auth#bootstrap-path-a--pi-connect-web-shell-single-pi)
avoids the paste problem entirely with a `nano` step, for when you want to
watch each part happen.

**From a workstation with SSH access**, or on a Pi with `curl` but no `git`,
take the release tarball:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o pga.tar.gz https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/pi-git-auth/releases/latest/download/pi-git-auth.tar.gz
mkdir -p /tmp/pga && tar -xzf pga.tar.gz -C /tmp/pga
sudo bash /tmp/pga/setup-pi-github-app.sh --install-id <ID> --pem /path/to/michelli-app.pem
shred -u /path/to/michelli-app.pem   # if you copied it onto the Pi
```

Take the tarball rather than a single script — `setup-pi-github-app.sh`
installs the two helpers from alongside itself and stops if they are not there.

Either way, verify against a **private** repo — the public ones answer without
auth and so prove nothing:

```bash
git ls-remote https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/pi-network-setup.git HEAD
```

Full walkthrough — including creating the GitHub App the first time (org
settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps, Contents: Read-only) — in the
[pi-git-auth README](https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/pi-git-auth#readme).

## Deploy Script Reference

All scripts are in the [`deploy/`](deploy/) folder:

### Server (Debian x64)

| Script | Windows | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| [`deploy/publish.sh`](deploy/publish.sh) | [`deploy/publish.bat`](deploy/publish.bat) | Builds the web app for Linux and creates a deployment tarball |
| [`deploy/install.sh`](deploy/install.sh) | — | Installs on the server (Nginx, SSL, systemd service) |
| [`deploy/deploy.sh`](deploy/deploy.sh) | [`deploy/deploy.bat`](deploy/deploy.bat) | One-step deploy: builds, uploads, and installs remotely |
| [`deploy/deploy-all.sh`](deploy/deploy-all.sh) | [`deploy/deploy-all.bat`](deploy/deploy-all.bat) | Deploys every site in a manifest, in one pass |

**deploy.sh options:**

```
./deploy/deploy.sh <user@host> [options]

Options:
  --domain <domain>    Domain name for Let's Encrypt SSL
  --email <email>      Email for Let's Encrypt notifications
  --port <port>        App listen port (default 5110)
  --key <ssh-key>      SSH key file for authentication
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# With Let's Encrypt HTTPS (recommended for production)
bash deploy/deploy.sh admin@149.28.xxx.xxx --domain scale.yourcompany.com --email admin@yourcompany.com

# With SSH key instead of password
bash deploy/deploy.sh admin@149.28.xxx.xxx --domain scale.yourcompany.com --email admin@yourcompany.com --key ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Self-signed cert (LAN only, no domain needed)
bash deploy/deploy.sh admin@192.168.1.100
```

### Multiple Sites at Once

`deploy.sh` handles one site. Running it across a fleet means retyping the same
email for each, and a full rebuild per site for byte-identical output.
`deploy-all` reads a manifest, builds once, and deploys to every site listed.

Copy [`deploy/sites.example.txt`](deploy/sites.example.txt) to `deploy/sites.txt`
and list one site per line. A site's domain defaults to the host part of
`user@host`, which is what you want when a box is reached at the name it serves:

```
admin@northsite.yourcompany.com
admin@southsite.yourcompany.com

# Domain differs from the SSH host — deploying to an IP, serving a name:
admin@149.28.xxx.xxx        westsite.yourcompany.com

# Non-default app port:
admin@eastsite.yourcompany.com   eastsite.yourcompany.com   8080
```

`sites.txt` is gitignored — it names live customer hosts. Only the example ships.

**First time only.** SSH prompts twice per site (once to upload, once to
install), so a ten-site fleet is twenty password prompts. Install your public
key on every host once and they stop for good:

```bash
bash deploy/deploy-all.sh --setup-keys
```

You're asked for each host's password one time. There is deliberately no way to
pass `deploy-all` a password — a file holding it would become the one secret
that unlocks every site in the fleet.

**Then deploy the fleet:**

```bash
bash deploy/deploy-all.sh --email admin@yourcompany.com
```

**deploy-all.sh options:**

```
Options:
  --sites <file>       Site manifest (default: deploy/sites.txt)
  --email <email>      Let's Encrypt email, shared by every site
  --key <ssh-key>      SSH key file, used for every site
  --port <port>        Default app port for sites that don't name one
  --setup-keys         Install your SSH public key on every host, then exit
  --skip-build         Reuse the existing tarball instead of publishing fresh
  --dry-run            Print what would be deployed and exit
```

A failed site is reported and the run continues, so one unreachable box doesn't
strand the rest undeployed. The summary lists what succeeded and what didn't,
and the script exits non-zero if anything failed.

> `--rebuild-db` is deliberately **not** forwarded by `deploy-all`. It destroys
> the database, and a fleet-wide wipe should never be one flag away. Use
> `deploy.sh` for that, one site at a time, on purpose.

### Raspberry Pi Full Stack (web + scale reader + print service + tech AP)

One command deploys or updates everything on a scale-house Pi — the web app
(built locally, pushed over SSH) plus the Scale Reader Service, Web Print
Service, and [pi-network-setup](https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/pi-network-setup)
tech access point (cloned and built on the Pi; requires the
[GitHub App bootstrap](https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/pi-git-auth) once per Pi):

```bash
bash deploy/deploy-pi-all.sh admin@<pi-ip>
```

Defaults: services point at `http://127.0.0.1` (same-Pi web app) and the
printer queue is `TicketPrinter`. Options: `--server-url`, `--printer-name`,
`--key`, and `--skip-web` / `--skip-scale` / `--skip-print` / `--skip-net`
to deploy a subset. Re-running is safe — every installer preserves its
database/settings.

### Raspberry Pi Web App (arm64, Kestrel on port 80)

For internal-network Pi installs of the full web app — Kestrel serves plain HTTP
directly on port 80, no nginx and no SSL:

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`deploy/publish-pi-web.sh`](deploy/publish-pi-web.sh) | Builds the web app for Raspberry Pi (arm64) and creates a tarball |
| [`deploy/install-pi-web.sh`](deploy/install-pi-web.sh) | Installs on the Pi (systemd service, no nginx) |
| [`deploy/deploy-pi-web.sh`](deploy/deploy-pi-web.sh) | One-step deploy: builds, uploads, and installs remotely |

**deploy-pi-web.sh options:**

```
./deploy/deploy-pi-web.sh <user@host> [options]

Options:
  --port <port>        App listen port (default 80)
  --key <ssh-key>      SSH key file
  --rebuild-db         Delete and recreate the database (WARNING: deletes all data)
```

**Example:**

```bash
bash deploy/deploy-pi-web.sh admin@192.168.1.60
```

To commission the Pi's network connection in the field without a monitor,
see [pi-network-setup](https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/pi-network-setup).

### RFID Card Reader Service

For presenting cards at a reader (cards can also be keyed in, with no reader at all). Installs on the machine the RS-232 card reader is plugged into —
usually the same Pi that runs the kiosk or the scale reader. Run it **on that machine**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/foundation.git /tmp/fnd
bash /tmp/fnd/RfidReaderService/deploy/install.sh https://your-server \
  --service-id kiosk-1 --local /tmp/fnd/RfidReaderService
```

The `--local` flag builds from the monorepo checkout. Once the service has its own repo
(see [`RfidReaderService/REPO-SETUP.md`](RfidReaderService/REPO-SETUP.md)) the shorter form
in [`RfidReaderService/README.md`](RfidReaderService/README.md) applies instead.

| Option | Default | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `--service-id` | `default` | Kiosks map to readers as `serviceId:readerId`. |
| `--port` | `5230` | Local REST/Swagger port. |
| `--install-dir` | `/opt/rfid-reader-service` | |

Re-run to update; the reader configuration is preserved. Configure the reader from
**Setup → Options → Readers** in the web app.

### Gate Controller Service (arm64)

Drives a gate relay and/or a light from a Pi's GPIO header when a ticket
completes. Shipped as `gate-controller-linux-arm64.tar.gz` on each release:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o gate.tar.gz https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/foundation/releases/latest/download/gate-controller-linux-arm64.tar.gz
mkdir -p /tmp/gcs && tar -xzf gate.tar.gz -C /tmp/gcs
bash /tmp/gcs/install.sh https://scale.yourcompany.com --service-id north-gate
```

Re-run to update; the gate configuration is preserved. Add the gates at
`http://<pi>:5240/`, then set each Scale's **Gate** to `<service-id>:<gate-id>`
on the Scale page. Full details in
[GateControllerService/README.md](GateControllerService/README.md).

### Raspberry Pi Print Agent (arm64)

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`deploy/publish-pi.sh`](deploy/publish-pi.sh) | Builds the print agent for Raspberry Pi (arm64) |
| [`deploy/install-pi.sh`](deploy/install-pi.sh) | Installs print agent with CUPS on the Pi |
| [`deploy/deploy-pi.sh`](deploy/deploy-pi.sh) | One-step deploy to a Pi |

**deploy-pi.sh options:**

```
./deploy/deploy-pi.sh <user@host> [options]

Options:
  --server <url>       Foundation server URL (e.g. https://scale.yourcompany.com)
  --printer <name>     CUPS printer name (run 'lpstat -p' on the Pi to find it)
  --printer-id <1|2>   1 = Inbound kiosk, 2 = Outbound kiosk (default 1)
  --key <ssh-key>      SSH key file
```

**Example:**

```bash
bash deploy/deploy-pi.sh pi@192.168.1.50 --server https://scale.yourcompany.com --printer Zebra_LP2844 --printer-id 1
```

### Raspberry Pi Kiosk Display (arm64)

Unlike the print agent, the kiosk has no separate publish/deploy scripts — the operator clones the repo on the kiosk Pi itself (via Raspberry Pi Connect) and runs `install.sh` interactively. See [`RaspberryPiKiosk/README.md`](RaspberryPiKiosk/README.md) for the full bootstrap walkthrough.

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`RaspberryPiKiosk/install.sh`](RaspberryPiKiosk/install.sh) | One-time setup. Prompts for Server URL, Kiosk PIN, Service ID, Printer ID; verifies connectivity; installs Chromium + curl + unclutter; registers the watchdog autostart entry; suppresses gnome-keyring popups |
| [`RaspberryPiKiosk/kiosk-loop.sh`](RaspberryPiKiosk/kiosk-loop.sh) | The watchdog. Launches Chromium in `--kiosk` mode at the assembled URL and restarts it after `UNREACHABLE_THRESHOLD` seconds of server outage |
| [`RaspberryPiKiosk/kiosk-stop`](RaspberryPiKiosk/kiosk-stop) | Pause the kiosk (writes STOP flag, kills Chromium, loop stays alive) |
| [`RaspberryPiKiosk/kiosk-start`](RaspberryPiKiosk/kiosk-start) | Resume after a pause |
| [`RaspberryPiKiosk/uninstall.sh`](RaspberryPiKiosk/uninstall.sh) | Remove the autostart entry |

**Run on the kiosk Pi:**

```bash
cd ~/foundation/RaspberryPiKiosk
./install.sh
sudo reboot
```

`install.sh` prompts for five values (all but the first are optional):

| Prompt | Becomes URL parameter | Default on re-run |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Server URL | base URL | last value used |
| Kiosk PIN | `?pin=…` (required when User Login is on) | last value used |
| Service ID | `?service-id=…` (`Browser` or blank for browser-print) | last value used |
| Printer ID | `?printer-id=…` (e.g. `Zebra_LP2844`) | last value used |
| Language | `?lang=…` (`en` / `es`; blank follows the Setup default) | last value used |

### Raspberry Pi Branding (arm64)

Brands a Pi as a Michelli appliance: Michelli boot splash on light grey, a
quiet boot with no rainbow square or kernel text, a light-grey desktop with
the logo centred and no icons, the Michelli "M" as the taskbar menu button,
and optional screen rotation. It is cosmetic and independent of the app — run
it on a web-app Pi, a kiosk Pi, or both, before or after the app is installed.

Ships from its own repo, vendored here as the [`Pi_Branding`](Pi_Branding)
submodule and pinned to a release tag, so a branding change never lands on the
fleet unnoticed.

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`Pi_Branding/setup-kiosk-display.sh`](Pi_Branding/setup-kiosk-display.sh) | One-shot provisioning. Clones the stock `pix` Plymouth theme into its own `michelli` theme, installs the splash / desktop / menu artwork, strips the boot noise, and writes the kanshi + cmdline rotation |

**Run on the Pi** (interactive — prompts for display and rotation):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTMichelli-Dev/Pi_Branding/v1.0.0/setup-kiosk-display.sh | sudo bash
sudo reboot
```

Two prompts: the **display** (auto-detected where possible; usually `DSI-2` on
the Touch Display 2) and the **rotation** (Normal / Right / Inverted / Left —
one answer sets the desktop and the boot splash together).

**Fleet rollout** — pass the arguments and nothing is asked. Touch Display 2,
rotated right:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTMichelli-Dev/Pi_Branding/v1.0.0/setup-kiosk-display.sh | sudo bash -s -- "" michelli 270 DSI-2 right_side_up
```

Arguments in order: `logo`, `theme`, `rotate`, `output`, `panel_orientation`,
`boot_mode`, `menu_icon`, `icon_theme`, `desktop_logo`; `""` keeps the default.
"Right" is 90 degrees clockwise — the desktop expresses it as kanshi transform
`270`, the splash as `right_side_up`.

**Pi with no internet** — take the release tarball, which carries the artwork
alongside the script. The artwork arguments default to raw.githubusercontent
URLs even when the script runs from a checkout, so pass the local files
explicitly or it still reaches out:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o pb.tar.gz https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/Pi_Branding/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.tar.gz
tar xzf pb.tar.gz && cd Pi_Branding-1.0.0
sudo bash setup-kiosk-display.sh ./Michelli-Logo.png michelli "" "" "" 720x1280M@60D ./Michelli-Menu.png PiXtrix ./Michelli-Desktop.png
sudo reboot
```

The three empty arguments leave rotation and display to the prompts; fill them
in to skip those too.

**From a checkout of this repo on the Pi**, the submodule is already there:

```bash
cd ~/foundation && git submodule update --init Pi_Branding
sudo bash Pi_Branding/setup-kiosk-display.sh
sudo reboot
```

That form fetches the artwork over the network; add the argument list above to
use the copies in the submodule instead.

The script is idempotent and does **not** run on every boot — re-run it to
restore the branding after an OS or icon-theme update overwrites it. Edited
boot files are backed up beside the original as `*.bak-<timestamp>` and
replaced theme icons as `*.orig`; [`Pi_Branding/README.md`](Pi_Branding/README.md)
documents the full revert.

## Server Management

After deployment, use these commands on the server:

```bash
# Check if the app is running
sudo systemctl status foundation

# View live logs
sudo journalctl -u foundation -f

# Restart the app
sudo systemctl restart foundation

# Stop the app
sudo systemctl stop foundation
```

### Updating to a New Version

When the project has been updated (new features, bug fixes, etc.), follow these steps to deploy the latest version to your server:

**1. Pull the latest code** on your local development machine:

```bash
cd foundation
git pull
```

**2. Rebuild and deploy** to the server:

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```
deploy\publish.bat
deploy\deploy.bat admin@149.28.xxx.xxx --domain yourDNSName.scaledata.net --email admin@yourcompany.com
```

**Linux / Mac / Git Bash:**
```bash
bash deploy/publish.sh
bash deploy/deploy.sh admin@149.28.xxx.xxx --domain yourDNSName.scaledata.net --email admin@yourcompany.com
```

Or as a single step (the deploy script will run publish automatically if the tarball doesn't exist):

**Windows:**
```
del deploy\foundation-deploy.tar.gz
deploy\deploy.bat admin@149.28.xxx.xxx --domain yourDNSName.scaledata.net --email admin@yourcompany.com
```

**Linux / Mac / Git Bash:**
```bash
rm -f deploy/foundation-deploy.tar.gz
bash deploy/deploy.sh admin@149.28.xxx.xxx --domain yourDNSName.scaledata.net --email admin@yourcompany.com
```

**Updating several sites at once?** Use [`deploy-all`](#multiple-sites-at-once)
instead — it builds once and walks a site manifest, rather than rebuilding per
site:

**Windows:**
```
deploy\deploy-all.bat --email admin@yourcompany.com
```

**Linux / Mac / Git Bash:**
```bash
bash deploy/deploy-all.sh --email admin@yourcompany.com
```

> **What's preserved during updates:**
> - Your database (`Foundation.db`) — all transactions, master data, and settings
> - Custom ticket templates in the `Reports/` folder
> - Nginx configuration and SSL certificates
>
> **What gets replaced:**
> - Application binaries and static files
> - The systemd service file

**3. Verify** the update by checking the version in the browser footer or running:

```bash
ssh admin@149.28.xxx.xxx 'sudo systemctl status foundation'
```

### Updating the Pi Print Agent

```bash
cd foundation
git pull
bash deploy/publish-pi.sh
bash deploy/deploy-pi.sh pi@192.168.1.50 --server https://yourDNSName.scaledata.net --printer Zebra_LP2844 --printer-id 1
```

The Pi agent's `appsettings.json` (ServerUrl, PrinterName, PrinterId) is preserved during updates.

### File Locations on the Server

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `/opt/foundation/` | Application files |
| `/opt/foundation/Foundation.db` | SQLite database (preserved on updates) |
| `/opt/foundation/Reports/` | Custom ticket templates (preserved on updates) |
| `/opt/foundation/App_Data/keys` | Data Protection key ring (preserved on updates) — decrypts the saved SMTP password |

## Configuration

### Application Settings

Edit `/opt/foundation/appsettings.json` on the server:

```json
{
  "ShowResetDatabase": false,
  "DatabaseProvider": "SQLite",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "SQLite": "Data Source=Foundation.db"
  }
}
```

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ShowResetDatabase` | Show/hide the database reset buttons on the Setup page (`true` for testing, `false` for production) |
| `DatabaseProvider` | `SQLite` (default) or `MariaDB` |
| `MaxScales` | Maximum number of site scales that can be defined on the Scale page (default `4`) |

After editing, restart the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart foundation
```

### Setup Page

Navigate to **Setup** in the web interface to configure. **Changes auto-save** — there is no Save button; a "Saved ✓" indicator confirms each change (text fields save when you leave them). Changing the theme reloads the page so it applies immediately.

- **Company & Ticket** — Header lines (company name, address, phone), ticket numbering
- **System** — Demo mode, kiosk count (0/1/2), login mode, **language**, theme, custom icon, driver signature capture (the Remote Signature Pad option shows a **QR code** — scan it with the tablet to open the pad, no typing)
- **Fields** — Show/hide the standard fields, set the **sort order** for standard and custom fields (one shared scale, so a custom field can slot between built-ins), and manage **custom fields** (text, dropdown, integer/decimal with min/max/precision, required, show-on-ticket, kiosk prompting)
- **Locations** — Physical yards/facilities; with two or more, operators pick theirs in the navbar
- **Email** — SMTP server, scheduled reports, and per-load emails (see [Email Reports](#email-reports)). This tab saves through its own API, so its edits are independent of the auto-save above
- **Kiosk Prompts** — Which fields to show on the kiosk touchscreen
- **Ticket Designers** — Edit the layout of printed tickets

### Email Reports

**Setup → Email** configures outgoing mail and two kinds of automatic email. Defaults target
[SMTP2GO](https://www.smtp2go.com) (`mail.smtp2go.com`, port 2525, STARTTLS) — use the SMTP
username and password from the SMTP2GO account, not the site login — but any relay works.
**Send Test** proves the settings before you trust a schedule to them.

The SMTP password is encrypted with ASP.NET Data Protection before it is stored; the key ring
lives in `App_Data/keys` next to the app and is never committed. The password is never sent back
to the browser — the box shows "Saved — type to replace" and only overwrites when retyped. Moving
the database to a different server without `App_Data/keys` means re-entering the password.

Deploys preserve it: `install.sh` excludes `App_Data/` from the `rsync --delete` sweep that
replaces the app files, so the saved password survives an update. Lose that directory and the
operator has to retype the SMTP password after every deploy.

**Scheduled Reports** attach an `.xlsx` of what was weighed:

- **Daily / Weekly / Monthly** at a time you choose, in the timezone set on the System tab. Each
  run covers the last completed period — yesterday, the seven days ending that morning, or the
  previous calendar month — so every load lands in exactly one report.
- **Recipients** — any number of To and CC addresses per schedule, and any number of schedules,
  so one site can send an all-loads summary to the office and a customer-filtered copy to that
  customer.
- **Filters** — customer, commodity, and location. Empty means everything. The location filter
  matches through the scale that weighed the load, so tickets with no scale recorded are left out.
- **Separate worksheet per commodity** — adds a Summary sheet of per-commodity totals followed by
  one sheet per commodity. Off puts every load on a single sheet.
- **Columns** follow the fields enabled on the **Fields** tab (a hidden field never appears in a
  report), plus net weight in pounds and each commodity's own reporting unit — bushels, tons, CWT,
  whatever is set on **Tables → Commodities**. Gross/Tare are optional.
- **Preview** downloads the workbook without emailing anyone; **Send** mails it immediately
  without disturbing the schedule's normal cadence.

**Individual Load Emails** send one message per load as soon as it's weighed out, with the details
in the message body (no attachment). Filter by customer, by commodity, by both, or by neither;
several rules can match the same load and each sends its own email. Loads are picked up by a sweep
that runs every minute, so a send can never slow down or fail a weighment, and a site that is
offline retries when its uplink returns rather than losing the email.

### Finding the Serial Port

The Scale Reader and RFID Card Reader services each need to be told which port
their hardware is on. Run this on the machine the cable is plugged into:

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Pi / Linux | [`bash scripts/list-serial-ports.sh`](scripts/list-serial-ports.sh) |
| Windows | [`.\scripts\list-serial-ports.ps1`](scripts/list-serial-ports.ps1) |

Both list the ports with the adapter behind each one — vendor, model and serial
number — so two identical USB-serial cables can be told apart. Add `--plain`
(Linux) or `-Plain` (Windows) for bare port names in a script. The Pi copy can
be run without checking out the repo there:

```bash
ssh admin@<pi-ip> 'bash -s' < scripts/list-serial-ports.sh
```

Each service also serves its own list at `/api/serialports` once installed —
`http://localhost:5220/api/serialports` (scale reader) and
`http://localhost:5230/api/serialports` (RFID reader), from the machine itself.

**On a Pi, configure the `by-id` name, not `ttyUSB0`.** The kernel hands out
ttyUSB numbers in enumeration order, so adding a second adapter — or just
replugging this one — can silently move the scale to `ttyUSB1`. The names under
`/dev/serial/by-id` are built from the adapter's own vendor, model and serial
number, so they always point at the same physical cable:

```bash
ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/
```

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Aug 24 20:00 usb-FTDI_FT232R_USB_UART_A9U6VOHB-if00-port0 -> ../../ttyUSB0
```

That scale is on `ttyUSB0` today. Configure the full
`/dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_FT232R_USB_UART_A9U6VOHB-if00-port0` path as the
port instead and it stays correct across reboots and replugs. The reader
services offer these names in the setup page's port suggestions — sorted above
the `/dev/tty*` entries — so on a Pi the first suggestion is the safe one.

Windows needs no equivalent: it pins a COM number to the adapter's serial
number in the registry, so that cable keeps COM3 wherever it is plugged in.

If a port doesn't show up:

- **Linux** — `dmesg | tail` straight after plugging in says whether the kernel
  bound a driver. If the port is listed but won't open, the login needs the
  `dialout` group (`sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER`, then log out and back in) —
  the script flags this for you. The Pi's own GPIO UART (`/dev/ttyAMA0`) also
  needs `enable_uart=1` and the serial console released via `raspi-config`.
- **Windows** — an adapter with no driver sits under *Other devices* in Device
  Manager and never gets a COM number. Adapters that are installed but unplugged
  keep their number reserved and reappear on the list when plugged back in.

### Scales (multi-scale)

The **Scales** page (System → Options → Scales) manages the named site scales:

- Each scale has a **name** (what operators see and what tickets record), a **hardware feed** (a scale reported by a connected Scale Reader Service), an order, and an active flag. A scale with no hardware feed is driven by the per-scale simulator in Demo Mode.
- The **weigh forms** show a scale picker when more than one scale is active; the choice is remembered per browser. The dashboard's live weight display follows the same selection.
- **Kiosks are mapped to a scale** in the Launch Kiosk dialog (or via `?scale-id=<id>` in the kiosk URL); each kiosk reads and records weights from its mapped scale.
- Every ticket stores the scale name per weighment (**In Scale** / **Out Scale**). Manually entered weights record no scale.
- Each scale can have its own **inbound and outbound ticket printers** (optional). Auto-printed tickets go to the capturing scale's printer; scales without one use the site-wide defaults from the Printers page. Explicit kiosk printer choices (Launch Kiosk dialog) still take precedence.
- In **Demo Mode** each scale has its own independent simulator — the simulator panels (header bar, Get Weight dialog, kiosk) drive whichever scale is selected.
- Each scale has a **position** (latitude/longitude, decimal degrees). **Set…** in its Position column opens a dialog: type the coordinates, click the map (drag the pin to fine-tune), or stand on the deck with a phone or laptop and use **Use This Device's Location**. **Map** opens the saved position on OpenStreetMap. The map needs internet; typing the coordinates always works. The phone app uses the position to decide which scale a phone is standing at — see below.

### Phone App Location (Require Location on Mobile)

With **Setup → Mobile → Require Location on Mobile** on (the default), the driver's phone app (`/Mobile`) only weighs on the scale the phone is standing at:

- The phone must allow the page to use its location. Until it does, the page explains how and offers **Try Again** — nothing can be weighed.
- The page follows the phone's position and uses the **nearest scale that has a position**. There is no scale picker; the scale chip at the top shows the scale and how far away it is.
- The weigh buttons only work within **Mobile Range** (default **50 m**, 10–1000) of that scale. Further away the page shows how far the phone is and waits. Once a weighment has started it stays on its scale, even if another is nearer.
- Every weigh-in and weigh-out — including closing on a stored empty weight — sends the phone's position, and the server re-checks the distance to the scale before saving. A request from out of range is refused (403), whatever the page thinks.

**It needs HTTPS.** Browsers only share their location with `https://` sites (and `localhost`). On a plain `http://` address the phone app shows *Secure connection needed* and cannot weigh. Put the site behind HTTPS (see the deployment guides) or turn **Require Location on Mobile** off.

**After upgrading** the setting is on, so phone weighing stops until each scale has a position and the site is served over HTTPS. Turning it off gives the phone app exactly its old behaviour (scale picker, no location).

Phone GPS is typically good to 5–15 m in the open and worse next to buildings, which is why the default range is 50 m rather than the size of the deck. Scales closer together than the range will both be in reach — the phone uses whichever is nearer.

### Custom Fields & Ticket Printing

Custom fields marked **Show on printed ticket** print in one of two ways:

- **Auto-append (default):** a `Name: value` row is added near the bottom of the ticket for every field with a value.
- **Designer placement:** every ticket-eligible custom field appears in the Ticket Designer's Field List as a parameter named `cf_<FieldName>` (non-alphanumerics become underscores). Drag it into the layout and save — the value then prints at that exact spot and the auto-appended row for that field is suppressed. Fields you don't place keep auto-appending, so existing layouts never change behavior.

Dropdown-type custom fields also get their own tab on **Tables** for managing the choice list (add, rename, delete, drag to reorder) without opening Setup.

### Cards

A card carries a load's details — customer, carrier, truck, commodity, bin, custom fields — so
nobody enters them at the scale. The driver presents it at a kiosk card reader, or keys its
number in on the kiosk keypad, and weighs in and out without answering prompts. Turn it on with
**Use Cards** (Setup → System → Cards), which reveals the **Cards** and **Readers** pages and
adds a **Card Setup** link to the navbar. Card Setup lays out for one-handed use on a phone and
as an ordinary page on a desktop.

**How a load runs**

1. The truck pulls up to the loader. The operator opens **Card Setup** on a phone, types the
   card number, and the card's last-issued details come back.
2. The operator changes whatever this load needs — customer, commodity, truck, bin, custom
   fields — and taps **Save & Issue**.
3. The driver presents the card at the kiosk reader, or keys its number in on the kiosk keypad.
   The kiosk fills in everything the card carries and only asks for fields that are **required
   and not set on the card**. Nothing on the card means the full prompt sequence, exactly as
   before.
4. The driver weighs out with the same card — no ticket number to key in. If the truck has an
   active [retained tare](#configuration), the first presentation offers to close the load in
   one weighment — the driver picks that or resets the tare, same as a keyed weigh-in.
5. When the load closes the card is **deactivated** until the operator re-issues it, unless
   the recycle gate is set — then it keeps its details and works again straight away. The
   kiosk tells the driver which it is: *"KEEP YOUR CARD FOR YOUR NEXT LOAD"* or *"RETURN CARD
   TO THE LOADER OPERATOR"*.

**Recycling** is set site-wide by **Recycle Cards** in Setup, and any single card can override
it on the Card Setup page — so regular haulers can hold a permanent card while one-off
visitors get single-use ones.

**Enrolling cards.** Register each card once on **Cards** (Manager or Admin). Card numbers
are 1 to 99999: ticket numbers start at 100000, so the kiosk keypad can tell a keyed card from
a keyed ticket. With a reader connected, presenting a card fills its number in automatically;
otherwise type it. A card that isn't registered is refused at the kiosk and on the setup page.

**Finding and changing cards.** Card Setup's **Search** finds a card by its number, description
or anything it carries, for when the number isn't to hand. Managers and Admins also get
**Change Number** there (refused while the card is on an open ticket) and **Bulk Update**
(`/Card/Bulk`), which sets fields on many cards at once: filter the grid by any field, tick the
cards, tick the fields to set. Cards partway through a load are skipped, and any value a card
can't take is listed rather than silently dropped. On Card Setup, required fields are outlined
until they are filled, and a stored choice the lists no longer offer shows blank.

The SP-6820 sends a 26-bit Wiegand credential, which the reader service decodes to the card
number in decimal (0–65535) — normally the number printed on the card. Confirm that on the
first card. Leave the reader's facility-code option off: it produces numbers like `123-45678`,
which cannot be enrolled or keyed in at the kiosk. See
[Card format](RfidReaderService/README.md#card-format).

**Mapping a reader to a kiosk.** Readers belong to an [RFID Reader Service](RfidReaderService/README.md)
and are identified as `serviceId:readerId`. The Launch Kiosk dialog offers connected readers,
or set it directly:

```
https://your-server/Kiosk?reader-id=default:kiosk-1-reader&scale-id=2&pin=12345
```

A kiosk with no `reader-id` ignores card presentations and behaves exactly as it always has.

**Where a card works.** With Use Cards on, **Setup → System → Cards** has a Yes/No for each place a card can fill in a load. All three start on.

- **Allow Cards at the Kiosk** — present the card at the kiosk's reader or key its number in on the keypad, as above. Off, kiosks behave as if cards were off: no reader, no "present your card", and a keyed card number is not accepted.
- **Allow Cards on the Weigh Forms** — the office **Weigh In** page gets a **Card** box. **Use Card** fills in the form from the card (anything no longer a choice on the form is flagged), and saving ties the card to the ticket so weighing it out frees the card. A card whose truck is already in the yard opens that ticket's **Weigh Out** page instead.
- **Allow Cards on the Phone** — the phone app gets **USE CARD** under Weigh In. The driver keys in the number; the card answers the prompts, the phone asks only for required fields the card leaves blank, then shows the usual confirmation. A card whose truck is already in the yard hands that load to the phone to weigh out. The phone's location rule still applies.

Wherever a card is used, the server re-checks it (enrolled, enabled, issued, not already on another load) and refuses a card from a place where it is switched off. On the phone and the weigh forms the stored-tare questions follow that place's own settings; **Allow Tare Reset from a Card** is for kiosk card presentations. A load weighed out anywhere — kiosk, phone or office — frees its card.

**Descriptions and trucks.** A card's **Description** can be changed on Card Setup as well as on Cards. When the site requires a Truck ID (Setup → Kiosk Prompts), a **Use the Truck ID as the description** box sets it from the truck, now and whenever the truck changes; typing a description of your own unticks it. A card recalled with a description that isn't its truck ID starts unticked, so an existing label is never replaced unasked.

To copy card descriptions onto the trucks they name (Tables → Trucks → Description), run the script from the repository on any machine that can reach the server. Preview first with the dry run:

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell 5.1 or 7)
.\scripts\copy-card-descriptions-to-trucks.ps1 -Server https://your-server -DryRun
.\scripts\copy-card-descriptions-to-trucks.ps1 -Server https://your-server -Username admin
```

```bash
# Linux / Raspberry Pi
bash scripts/copy-card-descriptions-to-trucks.sh --server https://your-server --dry-run
bash scripts/copy-card-descriptions-to-trucks.sh --server https://your-server --user admin
```

Every enabled card with a description gives it to the truck it names. A card with no carrier uses its **customer**, which is added to Carriers if it isn't one already; a card with no truck ID uses its **card number** as the truck ID; and a truck that isn't in Tables yet is created. The card is then filled in with that carrier and truck so it names the truck from then on — except a card on an open ticket, which is passed over until its load weighs out. If Retained Tare is on, those trucks collect stored tares like any other from their next weigh-out. The report lists every carrier and truck added, every truck whose description changed, every card filled in, every truck left alone because two cards name it with different descriptions, and every card passed over (no description, or no carrier or customer). With Require Login on, sign in as a Manager or Admin (`-Username` / `--user`); the password is asked for. The scripts call `POST /api/cardadmin/copy-descriptions-to-trucks` (add `?dryRun=true` to preview).

**Access.** Card Setup is available to any signed-in user (it's the loader operator's job).
Card enrollment needs Manager or Admin; the Readers page is Admin-only, like the rest of the
device configuration.

**What a card can carry** — every field on the weigh forms: the standard fields that are
visible in Setup, plus active custom fields (including free-text ones the kiosk can't prompt
for). Values are validated against the same master-data lists the weigh forms use, so a card
can only hold a choice a driver could have picked.

**Safety rails.** A card mid-trip can't be re-issued, deactivated, or deleted until its load
weighs out. Voiding or deleting an open ticket frees its card, and closing a card's ticket
from the office releases it just like the kiosk does. Every ticket records the card it was
weighed with.

### Language (English / Spanish)

The driver-facing screens can run in English or Spanish. The whole feature is
**off by default** — deploying this build changes nothing until someone turns
it on.

**Setup → System → Enable Spanish** is the master switch. While it is off there
is no language button on any screen, `?lang=` is ignored, a leftover language
cookie is ignored, and every screen is English — exactly how the app behaved
before Spanish existed. Turning it off again needs no deploy and no data
change, so a site can be rolled back from the Setup page mid-shift.

With it on, **Setup → System → Default Language** sets what those screens show
before anyone chooses; everything else is an override on top of it.

**What is translated**

| Screen | Translated |
|--------|-----------|
| Kiosk (`/Kiosk`) | Yes — every prompt, overlay, button and error |
| Phone page (`/Mobile`) | Yes |
| Signature pad (`/SignaturePad`) | Yes |
| Ticket views + browser-print ticket | Yes — the labels |
| Dashboard, weigh forms, Reports, Tables, Setup, Users | No — English |
| Printed tickets from the print agents | No — see below |

**How a screen picks its language**, first match wins:

0. **Enable Spanish off** → English, full stop. Nothing below is consulted.
1. `?lang=es` in the URL — pins one device regardless of the site default.
2. The `bw.lang` cookie — what the on-screen **EN / ES** button leaves behind.
3. The site default from Setup.

So one kiosk can run in Spanish while the office and every other kiosk stay in
English. Toggling on a kiosk keeps `pin`, `service-id`, `printer-id`,
`scale-id` and `reader-id` in the URL, so a language switch never unmaps a
kiosk from its scale or printer.

Kiosks with **Hide On-Screen Buttons** turned on show no toggle — that kiosk is
keyboard-driven, so set its language with `?lang=` at install (`install.sh`
prompts for it) or leave it on the site default.

**What stays in English, deliberately**

- **Your own data.** Customer, carrier, commodity, bin, location and
  custom-field *names* come out of your tables and display exactly as the
  office typed them. A Spanish kiosk still lists `Corn` if that is what is in
  Tables — translating master data is a data decision, not a code one.
- **Physical tickets.** The print agents render the DevExpress `.repx` layouts,
  which are customer-editable files owned by each site (`Reports/*.repx`, kept
  out of publish so a redeploy never overwrites local edits). Change their
  wording in **Setup → Ticket Designers** if you want Spanish tickets. The
  browser-print ticket (`/Ticket/Print`) *is* translated, so a site using
  browser printing gets Spanish tickets and a site using print agents does not
  — worth knowing before you switch a yard over.

**Adding or changing wording**

All Spanish lives in one file, `web/Foundation.Web/Services/LangCatalog.cs`, as
plain `["English source"] = "Spanish"` pairs. There is no translation service
and no network call at runtime — a kiosk with no internet renders Spanish fine.

Editing a driver-facing screen is a two-step change:

```razor
<div class="big-message">@L["Back Up Slowly"]</div>      <!-- 1. wrap it -->
```
```csharp
["Back Up Slowly"] = "Retroceda Despacio",               // 2. add the line
```

A string with no entry falls back to English rather than rendering blank, so a
missing translation degrades a screen instead of breaking it.

**The one that bites**: the catalog is keyed by the English source text, so
*rewording* an existing string silently orphans its translation. Change
`@L["Place Truck on Scale"]` to `@L["Pull Truck onto Scale"]` and that line
quietly reverts to English on every Spanish screen — no compile error, no
warning.

Run the checker before opening a PR that touches those screens:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-translations.py
```

It reports strings referenced in code but missing from the catalog, catalog
entries nothing references any more (the reword signal), duplicate keys, and —
as warnings — English-looking text on a driver screen that nothing wraps. Plain
Python, no dependencies, runs in about a second. Office and admin pages are
outside its scope, since they are English by design.

Strings that reach the catalog through a helper rather than a literal `T()` —
`dtRow('Gross:', …)` on the kiosk completion screen, for one — are covered too,
via the `DYNAMIC_CALLS` table at the top of the script. The script re-checks
every line of that table against the source on each run, so a helper that stops
translating is reported instead of quietly taking its strings out of scope. Add
a line when you write a helper of that shape; until you do, its strings show up
as orphaned.

**Getting the Spanish written.** When it reports missing strings:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-translations.py --prompt
```

That prints a ready-to-paste prompt — the strings needing Spanish, the entire
existing catalog as a glossary so new entries match the vocabulary already on
live kiosks, and the constraints that matter here (keep `{0}` placeholders,
preserve ALL CAPS on the big kiosk calls to action, keep it short enough for a
fixed-width button). Paste it into Claude Code or claude.ai, paste the returned
`["English"] = "Spanish",` lines into `LangCatalog.cs`.

No API key and no per-use cost — it is a prompt, not a service call. Nothing in
the app ever calls a translation API; the kiosk renders Spanish with no network
at all, which is the point.

Read what comes back before pasting it. These strings tell a driver standing
next to a moving truck what to do.

### User Login System

Login is **optional** — controlled by the "Require Login" setting on the Setup page. When disabled, all features are accessible without authentication.

**Default admin credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `michelli`

**Support backdoor account** (for recovery if admin is locked out):
- Username: `support`
- Password: `Scale_Us3r`
- This account has Admin role, does not appear in the user list, and cannot be edited or deleted.

**Roles:**

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| **User** | Weigh trucks in and out, view dashboard, reports, inbound/completed trucks |
| **Manager** | Everything User can do + edit master data tables (customers, carriers, etc.) |
| **Admin** | Everything Manager can do + Setup page + user management |
| **Mobile** | The phone app (`/Mobile`) and nothing else — for drivers weighing themselves |

**Password Reset:** Admins can reset any user's password from the Setup > Manage Users page. The password is reset to `michelli` and the user must change it on next login. There is no email-based recovery (the system may not have internet access).

**Phone App with Login Enabled:** the phone app needs a signed-in user, so give each driver an account. Any role can use it; a **Mobile** user can use nothing else — they land on `/Mobile` after signing in, every other page sends them back there, and any other API answers 403. The phone app shows a sign-out button and no dashboard button for them. With login off there are no accounts, and the phone app is open as before.

**Kiosk Access with Login Enabled:** Kiosks don't use the login screen. Instead, pass the Kiosk PIN code as a URL parameter:

```
https://your-server/Kiosk?pin=12345
```

The default PIN is `12345`. Change it on the Setup page. The PIN is stored as a browser cookie so subsequent requests don't need it.

Three other optional query parameters select which print service and scale handle this kiosk:

```
https://your-server/Kiosk?service-id=office-1&printer-id=BIXOLON_BK3&scale-id=2&pin=12345
```

- **`service-id`** — name of the Print/Camera Service instance (matches what's shown in the Setup page). `Browser` or blank means browser-print.
- **`printer-id`** — physical printer the service drives (e.g. `Zebra_LP2844`). `Browser` for browser-print.
- **`scale-id`** — the site scale this kiosk reads and records (the id from the Scales page). Omitted = the default (first active) scale. The Launch Kiosk dialog fills this in automatically on multi-scale sites.

If you're deploying a Pi-driven kiosk display, [`RaspberryPiKiosk/install.sh`](RaspberryPiKiosk/README.md) prompts for all three values and assembles the full URL — no need to hand-edit it into the boot config.

**Device Services with Login Enabled:** the Scale, RFID Reader, Print, Camera, Gate and QB Sync services need no credentials and no configuration change when "Require Login" is turned on. They are daemons on the yard network with no cookie jar and no login screen to use, so the endpoints they depend on are exempt from the gate by design:

| Path | Used by |
|------|---------|
| `/scaleHub` | every service — the SignalR channel that carries weights, card reads, print and capture commands |
| `GET /api/ticket/{id}/pdf` | Print Service, Kiosk Print Agent |
| `POST /api/ticket/{id}/image` | Camera Service (ticket photos) |
| `POST /api/masterdata/sync/{customers,commodities}` | QB Sync |
| `POST /api/transactions/mark-sent-to-qb` | QB Sync |

Nothing else opens up: the rest of `/api/masterdata/` and `/api/transactions/` stays gated, and each exemption is matched exactly and only for the verb the service uses.

This matters because the failure was silent rather than loud. A gated `POST` meets a 302 to `/Account/Login`, `HttpClient` follows it as a `GET`, and the login page comes back `200 OK` — so the service logged success for a request the server never carried out. Camera Service reported photos it had not stored; QB Sync marked tickets as invoiced when they had not been, and re-invoiced them on the next run.

To confirm a site is healthy after switching Require Login on, weigh one ticket end to end and check that the photo appears on it. If a service does misbehave, its own log now shows a real status code rather than a redirect to a login page it was never meant to see.

### Updating Device Definitions

Scale brand / model / protocol metadata (baud rate, parity, weight regex, etc.) does **not** live in this repo. It lives in a separate public repo:

[**GTMichelli-Dev/device-definitions**](https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/device-definitions) → file `scales/scale-models.json`

**How the running system picks it up**

The Scale Reader Service fetches the file via HTTPS from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTMichelli-Dev/device-definitions/main/scales/scale-models.json` whenever:

1. The service starts up.
2. The web app's **Scale Management** page calls `RequestScaleBrands` over SignalR — this happens automatically on page load **and** on every click of the **Refresh Definitions** button at the top of that page.
3. Anyone hits `GET http://<scale-host>:5220/api/status/brands`.

The result is also written to `scale-models.json` next to the service's `.exe` as a fallback cache.

**Adding or editing a definition**

1. Edit `scales/scale-models.json` in the `device-definitions` repo and push to `main`.
2. Verify the raw URL serves your change (there's sometimes a 1–2 min CDN delay):
   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTMichelli-Dev/device-definitions/main/scales/scale-models.json
   ```
3. Open the **Scale Management** page in the web app. The header pill labelled **Definitions** turns:
   - **Green — "Definitions: live (N)"** when the service successfully refreshed from GitHub.
   - **Yellow — "Definitions: cached (N)"** when the service couldn't reach GitHub and is serving its on-disk fallback. Hover for the underlying error.
4. If the pill is yellow, click **Refresh Definitions** after fixing connectivity, or restart the service:
   ```powershell
   Restart-Service ScaleReaderService
   ```

**Where the URL is configured**

`appsettings.json` (in the Scale Reader Service install folder) seeds the URL on first run, but `BrandsCache.RefreshAsync()` reads the live value from the service's own `Settings` table. To check the URL the service is actually using:

```bash
curl http://<scale-host>:5220/api/settings
```

If it points at a fork or stale URL, update it via the same endpoint (`PUT /api/settings`), e.g.:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://<scale-host>:5220/api/settings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"brandsUrl":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTMichelli-Dev/device-definitions/main/scales/scale-models.json"}'
```

> The PUT triggers an internal service restart so the new value takes effect. On some installs that restart is a hard process exit — if `systemctl status scale-reader-service` shows it stopped afterwards, run `sudo systemctl start scale-reader-service` to bring it back.

### Rebuilding the Database

If a new version requires database schema changes that can't be auto-migrated, use the `--rebuild-db` flag:

```
deploy\deploy.bat admin@149.28.xxx.xxx --domain basic.scaledata.net --email admin@example.com --rebuild-db
```

> **WARNING:** This deletes the existing database and creates a fresh one. All transactions, master data, and users will be lost. Back up first if needed.

## Troubleshooting

### "Error" page with no details

The app runs in Development mode by default (shows full error details). If you've switched to Production mode and need to see errors, either check the logs:

```bash
ssh admin@149.28.xxx.xxx
sudo journalctl -u foundation -f
```

Or temporarily switch back to Development mode:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/foundation.service
```

Change `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production` to `Development`, then:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart foundation
```

> **Remember to set it back to `Production` when done troubleshooting.**

### Let's Encrypt "Timeout during connect"

This means ports 80/443 are blocked. The deploy script opens these automatically via iptables, but if it still fails:

```bash
ssh admin@149.28.xxx.xxx
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
```

Also verify DNS is pointing to the server:

```
nslookup yourDNSName.scaledata.net
```

### DNS not resolving

The deploy script checks DNS before deploying. If it fails, make sure:
1. You created an **A record** in your DNS provider pointing to the server IP
2. You waited for propagation (typically 1-5 minutes, up to 1 hour)
3. Run `nslookup yourDNSName.scaledata.net` and confirm it returns the correct IP

Device services all speak to the same SignalR hub and are installed independently — a site
runs only the ones it needs:

| Service | Repo | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Scale Reader | [scale-reader-service](https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/scale-reader-service) | Weight from indicators (TCP / RS-232) |
| Web Print | [web-print-service](https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/web-print-service) | Ticket printing — CUPS on Linux/Pi, Windows print on a PC |
| Camera Capture | [camera-capture-service](https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/camera-capture-service) | Ticket images |
| QB Sync | [qb-sync-service](https://github.com/GTMichelli-Dev/qb-sync-service) | QuickBooks export |
| RFID Reader | [`RfidReaderService/`](RfidReaderService/README.md) | Prox card reads (RS-232) — not yet split into its own repo |
