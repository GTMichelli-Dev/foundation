Check the Spanish catalog against the code that uses it.

    python3 scripts/check-translations.py

Exits non-zero when something would silently render in English on a Spanish
kiosk, so it can be wired into a PR check later if that becomes worth doing.

Why this exists
---------------
Services/LangCatalog.cs is keyed by the *English source text* of each string.
That is deliberate — a string with no entry falls back to readable English
instead of showing a driver a raw key like KIOSK_IDLE_MSG. The cost is that
rewording an English string silently orphans its translation:

    - @L["Place Truck on Scale"]        <- catalog has this
    + @L["Pull Truck onto Scale"]       <- catalog does not

No compile error, no warning; that line just reverts to English on every
Spanish screen. Nobody at a desk notices. A driver in the yard does.

What it reports
---------------
  MISSING    a T()/TF()/@L[] call naming a string the catalog lacks.
             Renders English on Spanish screens.
  ORPHANED   a catalog entry whose English text appears nowhere in the code.
             Usually the other half of a reword — fix the key or delete it.
  UNVERIFIED a helper listed in DYNAMIC_CALLS that no longer translates the
             argument it is listed for — see below.
  UNWRAPPED  (warning) English-looking text on a driver-facing screen that is
             not inside a translation call. Heuristic, so it has false
             positives; read them, don't obey them.

MISSING, ORPHANED and UNVERIFIED fail the run. UNWRAPPED never does.

Dynamic call sites
------------------
Not every key sits inside a T(). The kiosk's completion screen writes

    html += dtRow('Gross:', gross.toLocaleString() + ' lb');

and dtRow translates the label. DYNAMIC_CALLS lists those helpers — function,
declaring file, argument position — so their literals are checked like every
other call site: reword one to 'Gross Weight:' without adding a catalog line
and it is reported MISSING, exactly as a direct T() would be.

The table is a claim about the code, so the checker re-derives it every run:
each listed helper must still hand that argument to T(), directly or by
forwarding it to another listed helper. One that stops is UNVERIFIED, not
silently trusted. Write a new helper of this shape and its strings turn up
ORPHANED until you list it — noisy on purpose. The alternative is what this
file exists to prevent: a translation that quietly stopped rendering.

Getting the Spanish written
---------------------------
    python3 scripts/check-translations.py --prompt

prints a ready-to-paste prompt: the strings that need Spanish, the whole
existing catalog as a glossary so the new ones match the vocabulary already
deployed, and the constraints that matter on a kiosk screen. Paste it into
Claude Code (or claude.ai), paste the returned lines into LangCatalog.cs.

That path deliberately needs no API key and costs nothing beyond a Claude
subscription. Read what comes back before pasting it — these strings tell a
driver standing next to a moving truck what to do.

Translate UI strings into Spanish for Foundation, a truck-scale management
system used at grain elevators and scale houses in the United States.

Who reads these: truck drivers standing at a weigh scale, on a 1280x800
touchscreen kiosk (often in direct sun) or on their own phone. Many are native
Spanish speakers from Mexico and Central America. Use Latin American Spanish.

Rules:

1. Keep {0}, {1} placeholders exactly as written. Reorder them if Spanish word
   order needs it, but never drop or renumber one.
2. Preserve the capitalisation style. ALL CAPS strings are the large
   call-to-action text on the kiosk and must come back ALL CAPS. Title Case
   stays Title Case. lowercase stays lowercase.
3. Keep it short. These sit in fixed-width buttons, headers and overlays; a
   translation much longer than the English overflows the layout.
4. Use direct imperative address (usted implied, not written out).
5. Match the glossary below for any term that appears in it. Those strings are
   already deployed on live kiosks and the vocabulary has to stay consistent --
   a screen that says "Boleta" in one place and "Ticket" in another is worse
   than one that is all English.
6. If a string is genuinely ambiguous without more context, translate it and
   add a trailing comment saying what you assumed. Do not guess silently.

Return ONLY lines in this exact C# format, ready to paste into
web/Foundation.Web/Services/LangCatalog.cs, in the same order as the input:
